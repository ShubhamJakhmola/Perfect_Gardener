# Getting Started With Balcony Gardening

Balcony spaces can be perfect mini-gardens. With a bit of planning,
you can grow herbs, flowers, and even small vegetables.

## Essentials

- Choose 4â€“6 hours of sunlight
- Use lightweight pots with drainage
- Start with hardy herbs: mint, basil, rosemary

## Watering

Water when the top inch of soil is dry. Avoid waterlogging by ensuring
saucers are emptied after rain.

Happy growing!
